# StochasticGeometry_WLAN 
Stochastic Geometry Analysis of a WLAN network with Access Points (APs) distributed according to a Poisson Point Process (PPP) distribution with intensity lambda_a. 
This repository consists of the code for computing - 

1. Spatial Average of Probability of Transmission of an Access Point (AP) 
2. SINR distribution (SINR thresholds - 0 to 40 dB) 
3. Area Spectral Efficiency v/s Intensity of AP distribution
